            <p>
            The discovery of the <a href="../../detail/LoMoH/index.html" target="_blank">LoMoH</a> (<b>Lo</b>cked <b>Mo</b>de <b>H</b>ack) exploit began in 2019. This was at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as teachers were beginning to remotely give their classes quizzes in Google Forms with the locked mode feature that was recently introduced to prevent students from cheating on quizzes. To me, it was a fascinating feature, and seeing that a website such as Google Forms was able to lock itself down when the user clicks a button was a unique feature for Chrome OS. I mean, the Chrome Web Store has always had the special management permission so it can handle extensions, but Google Forms had become another privileged website.
            <p>
            I spent time fiddling with the feature, curious of how it worked and what ways locked mode (<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/assessment-assistant-dev/ibnfdimnablpmgpmgegnbdadookdffie" target="_blank">Assessment Assistant</a>) could be accessed. Luckily, there was no barrier to enabling locked mode from a student profile, so I was able to experiment at ease without notifying anyone. One thing that stood out to me is that the extensions which were installed had no access to the quiz while it was in locked mode. They still showed in the unusable context menu, but the fact that they did not work on the quiz page had somewhat already given it away. All I had to do is spend a while trying to navigate to Google Search (worked at the time) to visit a normally blocked website, and surely enough, it was successful.
            <p>
            But that was not the only vulnerability in the locked mode feature. Days passed, and I decided to experiment further by developing a simple bookmarklet that simply counted down a few seconds and then closed the tab while I would timely click the button to start the quiz. If timed right, that would trick the OS to behave as though the quiz was running but escaped from locked mode browsing, allowing the user to browse freely with extensions disabled. The only downsides were that screenshots were disabled and extensions that updated would be re-enabled, but neither were major issues.
            <p>
            I was shocked when it was successful. I had just discovered the first exploit that could disable extensions that were force-installed by the administrator, something I hadn't known was possible at the time. It did not spread around much for a while, and I had not shared it online.
            <p>
            Not much changed about the exploit for a couple of years as I shared it with a few friends. I realized the exploit was still working even then, and started to continue trying to improve the bookmarklet. Using a timer is not the best way to handle that type of task, so I changed the bookmarklet to close the window when the page was clicked. Later on, I realized it could get more specific by adding an event listener to the button, and after doing that and some other tweaks, the <a href="https://github.com/AshtonDavies/LoMoH?tab=readme-ov-file#bookmarklet-version" target="_blank">bookmarklet was complete</a>.
            <p>
            Some other day soon afterward, my friend was looking for a method to disable Hapara Highlights, which was an exception for locked mode as were the Snap&Read and other accessibility extensions. He informed me of a different bookmarklet that could disable extensions, and it was the <a href="../../detail/LTBEEF/index.html" target="_blank">LTBEEF</a> exploit. It utilized a vulnerability I had thought about before, because I knew that the Chrome Web Store was able to re-enable extensions that were disabled, which I used to my advantage to re-enable useful ones that were force-installed and disabled with this exploit, but I didn't know how to find the function that it ran to disable them, and I assumed that Google was surely smarter than that. Turns out, that is often not the case.
            <p>
            LTBEEF was a revolutionary extension disabler. It was so simple, too simple. Students used it at school whether or not they genuinely cared about bypassing extensions. It became a problem that was distracting students, so Google had to patch it in Chrome OS 106 and later versions of 102. I was fond of it too, although it had to go for productivity's sake. My locked mode exploit still worked, but administrators were blocking bookmarklets and I needed to do something to keep it working.
            <p>
            I began to code an HTML version and discovered that a bookmarklet wasn't really necessary to produce the effect. It had a button to open the quiz start page and it also had a button to start a timer. It couldn't apply listeners within the window, because that would be cross site scripting (XSS), which is of course blocked by web browsers, but a timer was fine as long as the exploit still worked. The page was deployed to Google Apps Script, and later moved to GitHub. Eventually I discovered that the launching process gave a brief unfocus from the start page onto the window behind it (LoMoH), which allowed the website to detect the quiz being launched at the perfect time. With this and a tiny URL handy, "unblocking" a typical random managed Chromebook could be as quick as under 15 seconds (depending on loading speeds)!
            <p>
            My friends were enjoying the new website, and I was happy to have the exploit working again, but more students began to use the website. They wanted a new way to bypass filters. The source of the spreading seemed to be one particular person for all I know, and site traffic was increasing with more visitors. I was of course happy as usual to be making others happy with the exploit, but it became noticed by more than just students, people who wanted to stop it. To mitigate visiting the site and any clones, "locked-mode-hack," which was the repository name on GitHub that is also part of the URL, was used as a blocking filter by administrators.
            <p>
            The exploit had exposed and reported to Google, which is something I possibly could have avoided if I had known it was that easy to make a site too popular. After renaming the GitHub repository to "LoMoH," thus giving the exploit a better title, people were able to continue using the website if they talked to me about the change. And so it continued with extra caution as I thought I had fixed everything and my opponents being blind to who was behind it.
            <p>
            When the patch came around to limit the effect to user-installed extensions, disappointment grew, but fate didn't happen that easily. This is because many Chromebooks were running Chrome OS 108 at the time, which, for many Chromebooks in various schools, had a <a href="https://reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/114riug/student_chromebooks_not_updating_past_v108" target="_blank">strange update behavior</a> in which it would not check for updates automatically, and some did not even receive later updates for a while until administrators took manual action. This was the time period when LoMoH didn't decay in users, because I finally shared it with people on the Internet who had not reached the patch on their Chromebooks yet, and gave the site indication to those who had it patched.
            <p>
            Although it didn't get much fame in the community during its three year lifetime compared to LTBEEF, which is said to have piled Bypassi#7037 in Discord DMs overnight, I really did discover the first exploit that could disable extensions that were force-installed, by tampering with the Locked Mode Feature rather than assume that Google had taken a smarter approach. On the bright side, locked mode is now improved from its previous buggy state.
